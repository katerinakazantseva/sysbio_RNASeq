## [DE,scRNA]_[DATASET]

### DE- MICROARRAY DIFF EXPRESSION
1) normalize the dataset and make sure it's in log-scale
2) make sense of the PCA plot: find outliers or check for batch effect
3) Design your DE to answer general question about the data
4) run DE and perform pathway enrichment using fgsea


### scRNA singel cell RNA-seq analisys

1) Preprocessing: filtering out bad cells and normalization
2) UMAP + clustering
3) Marker selection for clusters
