In infected samples what's different with KO?
Dataset:GSE122121 
1) normalize the dataset and make sure it's in log-scale
2) make sense of the PCA plot: find outliers or check for batch effect
3) Design your DE to answer general question about the data
4) run DE and perform pathway enrichment using fgsea
